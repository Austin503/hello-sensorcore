================

HelloSensorCore is a quick start sample demonstrating the usage of Step Counter API. The sample shows how to initialise and use StepCounter API. 

1. Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Learn about the Lumia SensorCore SDK from the Lumia Developer's Library. The
example requires the Lumia SensorCore SDK's NuGet package but will retrieve it
automatically (if missing) on first build.

To build the application you need to have Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone SDK 8.1
installed.

Using the Windows Phone 8.1 SDK:

1. Open the SLN file: File > Open Project, select the file `HelloSensorCore.sln`
2. Remove the "AnyCPU" configuration (not supported by the Lumia SensorCore SDK)
or simply select ARM
3. Select the target 'Device'.
4. Press F5 to build the project and run it on the device.

Alternatively you can also build the example for the emulator (x86) in which case
the Steps will use simulated data.

Please see the official documentation for
deploying and testing applications on Windows Phone devices:
